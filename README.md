## About

This repository contains a Java-based project that demonstrates the integration with several APIs to perform different tasks,
such as retrieving weather information, displaying maps and routes, fetching country data, and converting currencies.

## APIs Used
* OpenWeatherMap API: To fetch current weather and 5-day forecasts.
* Google Maps API: To display maps and calculate routes.
* REST Countries API: To retrieve information about countries.
* ExchangeRate-API: For currency conversion.

## Usage
Each class in the project is a standalone application that interacts with one of the APIs:

* WeatherApi.java: Run this class to get weather data.
* Maps.html: Open this HTML file in a web browser to view the map and route.
* CountriesApi.java: Run this class to get information about countries.
* CurrencyConverterApi.java: Execute this class to perform currency conversions.

## Output 
* The weather data for London and a 5-day forecast for Tokyo will be printed in the console.
* A map centered on New York City and a route from San Francisco to Los Angeles will be displayed in the web browser.
* Information about Brazil and a list of African countries will be shown in the console.
* The results of currency conversions (USD to EUR and JPY to GBP) will be outputted in the console.
